Hi, I'm **Aryan**, a student and a tech enthusiast. I love exploring new technologies and learning new skills. I have basic knowledge of **Python, MySQL and Java** and am currently trying out web development. As a **Linux and FOSS** enthusiast, I try to use free and open-source software and also promote it to a larger audience.

Some of my hobbies include photography, cycling, swimming and martial arts. I also like listening to music, and lately I've been listening to a lot of metal. I also wish to learn a musical instrument in the future probably the drums or the guitar.

I am very excited about the development of AI and, most importantly, chatbots like **ChatGPT, BingAI and Bard**. Although they have some flaws, their reliability has been commendable.

I created this portfolio website to showcase some of my projects and blog about various things. I hope you enjoy browsing through it and feel free to [contact](/contact) me if you have any questions or feedback.
